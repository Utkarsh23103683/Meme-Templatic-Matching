**A Deep Dive into Image-Text Semantic Analysis with CNN and CLIP**

📌 Overview-

This project tackles a novel and increasingly relevant challenge in AI: automated meme classification and template-based similarity analysis. With memes becoming a dominant mode of digital expression, accurately classifying and identifying their underlying templates can unlock powerful insights into social trends, content virality, and cultural evolution.
Leveraging Luke Bates’s “A Template is All You Meme” dataset, this research focuses on evaluating how effectively deep learning models can recognize, classify, and match memes across diverse templates. The goal? Build a scalable and intelligent system capable of understanding memes from both visual and textual perspectives.

🚀 Project Objectives-

Build a robust framework for template-based meme classification.
Compare the performance of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for traditional label prediction with CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining) for multimodal semantic similarity.
Evaluate model performance using key metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Cosine Similarity.

🧠 Methodology-

🔍 Data Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
Template Collection: A curated set of diverse meme templates, selected for their unique layouts and repetitive design patterns.
Preprocessing: Standardized image dimensions and text extraction steps to ensure consistency across all inputs.

Feature Encoding-

CNN: Extracts high-level visual features for label classification.
CLIP: Translates both images and associated text into semantically rich vector embeddings for similarity analysis.

🔗 Similarity Matching & Classification-

Each new meme is processed to extract visual and textual cues, transformed into numerical feature vectors.
Cosine Similarity is used to measure the resemblance between new memes and known templates.
Based on similarity scores, memes are matched to their closest template, and labels are predicted accordingly.

📊 Performance Evaluation-

Models were evaluated using:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score for classification effectiveness.
Cosine Similarity for template matching accuracy.

📈 Results & Insights-

The CNN model demonstrated high performance in label classification, achieving accurate predictions with consistent results.
CLIP excelled at semantic similarity and template recognition, outperforming CNN in tasks that required a deeper understanding of both image and text contexts.
